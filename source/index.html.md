# Overview

The Sigma Ratings API is designed to give our programmatic access to our risk intelligence data so that it may be easily integrated into internal systems and databases.  

Our RESTful API returns a JSON dataset.  Sigma language bindings are in Shell. Code examples can be viewed in the dark area to the right.

# Authentication

The Sigma API uses Basic Authentication to access the API.

To obtain an API key please contact our client support team @ Support@sigmaratings.com

## Basic Authentication

To authorize your request you need to specify a base64 encoded value of the provided Sigma API key in an Authorization header. See [RFC2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) for Basic Authentication reference. The following is an example of an encoded Authorization Header:

`Authorization: Basic c2lnbWFyYXRpbmdz`

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.sigmaratings.com/v1/account_status"
  -H "Authorization: Basic c2lnbWFyYXRpbmdz"
```


<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>"c2lnbWFyYXRpbmdz"</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
When using <code>curl</code> on Microsoft Windows you need to replace single-quotes in the examples with double-quotes. Alternatively, you can replace with <code>\"</code>.
</aside>

# Available Endpoints

This endpoint retrieves individual audit records. An audit record represents the request and response that was submitted using Sigma's API and it is used for traceability.

The following section describes in detail each field in the audit record:

Field | Description
--------- | ----------- | 
`audit_id` | Sigma's internal unique identifier assigned to a request.|
`user_id` | Represents the user that submitted the request. |
`organization_id` | Represents the organization for which the request was submitted. |
`request` | The request that was submitted as JSON payload. |
`response` | The response from the original request as JSON. |
`metadata` | Metadata from the original request. | 


Each request from the [risk](#risk-scoring) endpoint generates and `audit_id` field in its response, this id can be used to retrieve an audit record.

The Risk Scoring endpoint returns a Sigma Risk score for a given search term. 

The Sigma Risk score is calculated using the following criteria:

1. Each Risk Indicator not related to Sanctions and PEPs is applied an `Age Discounting` rate, this rate reduces 10 points per year based on when the event happened. 
1. A [squashing/sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) is applied to create a boundary for the following two cases:
  1. Based on the indicator category, multiple results of a given Indicator score accumulate at a different rate. For example: 3 PEP results at 50 points accumulate to 54.7 where 3 Adverse Media hits at 40 point accumulate to 40.1 points.
  1. A ceiling is applied for each category of indicator, regardless of how many indicators are returned. Example: For 100s of Adverse Media articles, the score can only grow by 10 points for that indicator category.
1. The final risk score is computed as taking the maximum value across all indicator scores (with `Age Discounting` applied) and then adjusting upward using the composite of Risk Indicators using `Dynamic Capping`.

The Sigma Risk score range is from: 0 - 100. 

These are some examples of how a Risk Score is calculated: <br />

**Search Term:** Acme Company

- **Indicators [Score]:** Sanctions [100], Adverse Media [50] x 3, Enforcement Action [70]
- **Final Score** = 100

**Search Term:** Oscorp

- **Indicators [Score]:** Adverse Media [50] x 15, Leadership [30]
- **Final Score** = 52.141

The Sigma Risk Level is determined based on the Sigma Risk Score, the higher the risk, the more severe the assigned level will be. 

Risk Level for each Score range: 

| Level | Score |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Elevated | 70 < Score <= 100 |
| Standard | 10 < Score <= 70 | 
| Neutral | 0 <= Score <= 10|

`POST https://api.sigmaratings.com/v1/risk`

### URL Parameters

Parameter |  Description
--------- |  -----------
`q` | Entity search value

### Request body

### Response

The API response is structured as: an `audit_id`, a `summary` section and `results` section. The `audit_id` is a uniquely identified id that can be used with the [audit endpoint](#audit) to retrieve a previously executed request. The `summary` data aggregates the results and can be used to build busines logic such as prioritizing investigations and segmenting searches. The `results` data enumerates all of the entity matches and their corresponding indicators and supporting data.

_**Summary Data**_ 

Field | Description
--------- | ----------- | 
`score` | Sigma's overall risk score for the search results. Based on the number and severity of risk `indicators` found, as measured by the individual indicator scores. Scored from zero to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher chance of risk. |
`level` | The level indicates the risk category and can be used for high level categorization of searches. It is based on Sigma Score and whether data was identified.  (Read more on levels) |
`detail` | Summary data that lists of all Risk Indicators found in the search and their corresponding counts. See Sigma Data Dictionary for detail on indicators. |

The `level` attribute includes four options:

Level | Description
--------- | ----------- | 
`Elevated` | Overall score above 70. At least one high-risk AML typology included in the risk indicators found in search. | 
`Standard` | Overall score greater than zero and less than 70. At least one risk indicator found in search. |
`Neutral` | Overall score of zero with at least on description found. Sigma has found data that may indicate line of business. |
`Unidentified` | No indicators or descriptions found in search. Minimal data identified across Sigma sources. Results may include location data via a corporate registry, but no line of business information available. |



_**Results**_

The results section includes detail of all available entity matches. Each match can have one or more risk indicators and supporting data such as locations and business descriptions.

Field | Description
--------- | ----------- | 
`description` | Business description of entity that a match corresponds to. Descriptions can be stated business descriptions from external sources, or Sigma derived from trade activity.
`indicators` | Summary of each Risk Indicator found in the search. See below for detail.
`locations` | Country and address data found that relates to the matched entity. See below for detail
`match_name` | Entity name for the corresponding match. Name may be the primary entity name, an alias, or transliterated or translated name.
`source` | Name of Sigma data integration the match is sourced from.
`strength` | 0-1 score to measure how close the match name is to the entity name being searched as the `q` parameter. The threshold filter can be used to limit returned matches based on their strength.
`type` | Denotes which Sigma Search option the match was returned from. Can be Company or People. Note Company search may return entities that are People, where they exist in unstructured or loosely structured sources.

Attribute detail for `indicators`:

Field | Description
--------- | ----------- | 
`category` | A grouping of similar risk types. Corresponds to the categories shown in the summary section.
`description` | Description of the risk indicator and the entity name it relates to.

The Bulk Risk Scoring status endpoint retrieves information about the bulk request. In addition to providing status of the bulk request, when the request completes, the status will display an additional field, a `presigned_url`. This url allows acccess to a compressed zip file containing the results of the bulk request. 

The compressed zip file is composed of three files:

- A Summary file, which aggregates all the data collected from each individual request. Summarizing the indicator count for each entity that was scored,
- A Details file, which contains details for each individual Risk Scoring request,
- and an Errors file, which is only be present if there were errors during the execution of the request. The errors file will contain an `id` and an error description, for each of the errors that were found.

## Bulk Monitoring

Monitoring provides the ability to continuously monitor a group of related entities that are grouped by a bulk id. To start monitoring a group of related entities use the 
[bulk endpoint](#bulk-risk-scoring) and specify `true` on the `monitored` query parameter of the [bulk endpoint](#bulk-risk-scoring). Updates to the entities are calculated periodically and can be [retrieved individually](#monitor-entity-updates) or by [bulk id](#monitor-bulk-updates).

The monitor bulk endpoint retrieves all the entities that are monitored for the specified bulk id. See [pagination](#pagination) section for reference.

```shell
curl "https://api.sigmaratings.com/v1/monitor/bulk/:id"
  -H "Authorization: mZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA=="
